# Project Name= Computer-Organization-And-Assembly-Language

# Objective;
 The prime objective of building a calculator in assembly language is to perform a number of calculations in response to user supplied input. This project work also focused principally on numbers and arithmetic operation. To determine and understand the current procedures employed in computer with regard to the calculator. To design a simple calculator that ensure timely processing, To reduce the problems immensely and provides a release working environment.

# Theory:
 To particularilize the matter and concept ‘we are going to design a calculator in assembly language. Inherent in the design of the simple calculator, the purpose of this project is to provide on overview of the simple design calculator. Basically a calculator is a person who performs arithmetic and other mathematical calculations   Finally, the goal of work is to improve the speed of the simple calculator in such a way that it will maximize the hardware needed and reduce the cost and complexity of the machine. This will help us to enjoy the anticipated high speed of our calculator.Basically, calculator in assembly language will help us to understand the different variety of commands , instructions and help us to gain intellectual knowledge through learning .This project allows to solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. Additionally it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allow the user to devote more time in understanding the problem.
